## Weekly Video Game Night!

![](images/videogame.jpg)

Join us at TheLab.ms every Saturday night from *7:00 to 10:00 PM* for *Video Game Night*!  We sit around a TV and play multiplayer video games like TowerFall Ascension, Knight Squad, Clusterpuck 99, and Rocket League.  Drinks are available, and we usually get some pizza from our friends at Marinara Pizza.
